# 🤝 Contributing to Fairsharecoin

Thank you for your interest in building a fairer world.  
Fairsharecoin is an open, transparent project — and your voice matters here.

You don’t need to be a developer.  
Designers, thinkers, critics, dreamers — **all are welcome**.

## 🧭 How to Contribute

### ✍️ 1. Share Ideas  
- Open a GitHub Issue with your thoughts, proposals, or questions
- Want to brainstorm together? Say so in the issue — we’ll respond

### 🛠️ 2. Contribute Code (in the future)
- At this stage, we’re not building a token or chain — we’re exploring *how* and *why* this should exist
- When prototypes begin, we'll clearly label tasks as `good first issue`

### 🌱 3. Help With Docs & Vision
- Improve the `README.md` or `ROADMAP.md`
- Translate content
- Help draft the whitepaper or build community resources

### 🎨 4. Design
- Visual identity, UI sketches, infographics
- Minimal, clean, universal
