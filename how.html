  <h1>How Fairsharecoin Works</h1>
  <p><strong>Fairsharecoin is not money. It’s a message.</strong></p>

  <h2>One Coin. One Person. For Free.</h2>
  <p>
    Every person on Earth gets exactly one Fairsharecoin. 
    You don’t buy it. You don’t mine it. You don’t earn it.
    You just get it — for existing.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
  <p>
    Today’s systems are built on debt, interest, and scarcity. 
    That means some people have everything. Others have nothing.
    Even Bitcoin, while powerful, is already concentrated in a few hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fairsharecoin is different. It says: what if we started from <strong>fairness</strong> instead of profit?
  </p>

  <h2>Is It Real?</h2>
  <p>
    Fairsharecoin is an idea being developed by a community of people who believe in fairness, openness, and post-monetary systems.
    There is no blockchain yet, and that’s on purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are building it slowly, publicly, and with no shortcuts.
  </p>

  <h2>What Can I Do With It?</h2>
  <p>
    Nothing — and everything. 
    Fairsharecoin isn’t for trading. It’s not “worth” anything in money. 
    But it’s worth everything in meaning.
  </p>
  <p>
    It proves one thing: you are here, and you count.
  </p>

  <h2>What's the End Goal?</h2>
  <p>
    Fairsharecoin is a <strong>stepping stone</strong>. 
    Once we build systems based on access, needs, and shared trust — we won’t need money at all.
    When that happens, Fairsharecoin dissolves.
