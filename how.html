  <h1>How Fairsharecoin Works</h1>
  <hr>

  <p>
    Fairsharecoin is designed as a truly fair and finite system of digital value.
    Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, it does not rely on mining, staking, or
    any form of competition. Instead, a single Fairsharecoin is minted per person —
    one and only one — when a unique verified user account is created.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ensures that every person receives an equal share of the total supply,
    regardless of whether they were the 100<sup>th</sup> or the 1,000,000<sup>th</sup> person to join.
    No one is left behind. The system is mathematically fair by design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once your verified account is created and your coin is received, you are free
    to use anonymous wallets, just like any other cryptocurrency. The verified identity
    is only required to ensure one fair coin per human.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fairsharecoin is not built for speculation, accumulation, or control — it’s a
    stepping stone toward a resource-based future, where fairness isn’t optional,
    but fundamental.
