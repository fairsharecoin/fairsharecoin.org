# Fairsharecoin: A Step Toward Post-Monetary Fairness

**Version 0.1 – DRAFT**

---

## 📌 Abstract

Fairsharecoin (FSC) is a conceptual digital asset representing a single, equal unit of value given to every person, once, for free — simply by virtue of being alive.  
It is not a currency designed for trade, speculation, or accumulation.  
It is a **symbol, signal, and transition mechanism** toward a resource-based economy.

---

## 🔍 1. Background

Modern economic systems — whether fiat or crypto — are rooted in scarcity, competition, and gatekeeping.  
They concentrate wealth, time, and access in ways that violate basic fairness. Even Bitcoin, while decentralized, remains unevenly distributed and inaccessible to many.

Fairsharecoin proposes a post-monetary, post-speculative approach —  
one where each living human being is granted a single, non-transferable unit of symbolic value.

---

## 🎯 2. Purpose

- Create a universal baseline of fairness  
- Explore identity-linked, non-monetary digital value  
- Provide a stepping stone toward post-currency, post-scarcity systems  
- Serve as an interspecies trust signal, should humanity ever encounter others

---

## ⚖️ 3. Core Principles

- **One coin per person**  
- **No mining, no buying, no trading**  
- **Non-transferable by design**  
- **Free to receive, free from debt**  
- **Open-source, community-guarded, and dissolvable**

---

## 🛠️ 4. Implementation (Conceptual)

Fairsharecoin does not currently exist as a deployed chain or smart contract.  
Its development will be driven by:

- Community consensus  
- Open ethical review  
- Collaboration with identity and anti-sybil researchers  
- Possible use of privacy-preserving, proof-of-personhood systems

---

## 🔐 5. Identity Without Surveillance

A major design challenge is confirming unique humans **without exploiting their data**.  
Explorations may include:

- Web of trust  
- Local peer-verification  
- Proof-of-humanity integrations  
- Time-based or biometric systems (used ethically and minimally)

---

## 🚫 6. What FSC Is Not

- Not a payment method  
- Not a store of value  
- Not a speculative asset  
- Not designed for price discovery  
- Not a government-issued universal basic income

FSC is a symbolic claim — not a currency.

---

## 🌱 7. Lifecycle and Dissolution

Fairsharecoin is not meant to last forever.  
Its final phase is *self-dissolution*, when:

- Humanity transitions to sustainable, access-based systems  
- Global coordination no longer requires currency  
- The protocol becomes irrelevant, and therefore, complete

---

## 📬 8. Roadmap Summary

See `ROADMAP.md` for active development phases.  
FSC is currently in the community formation and research phase.
