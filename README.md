# Fairsharecoin

**One person, one coin. Not more, not less. The future is fair.**

Fairsharecoin is a radically fair cryptocurrency designed to redefine how value is distributed. Unlike traditional systems based on mining, capital, or staking, Fairsharecoin operates on a single principle:

> 🎯 One coin is issued to each unique person. Once. Ever.

This creates a mathematically fair system. It doesn’t matter if you’re the 100th person or the millionth — **your share is equal**, and **your time is valuable**.

## 🌍 Why Fairsharecoin?

Modern money systems — fiat, crypto, or otherwise — often reward those who start early, invest heavily, or exploit loopholes. This project rejects that.

- ❌ No mining  
- ❌ No preallocation  
- ❌ No venture capital  
- ❌ No inflation  
- ❌ No founders’ advantage

- ✅ One person = One coin  
- ✅ Open source & community-led  
- ✅ Transparent, finite, and fair  
- ✅ Designed to bridge the gap between crypto and a resource-based future

## 🧱 How It Works

1. **One Coin = One Human:** A unique human account creates one and only one Fairsharecoin. Ever.  
2. **Transparent Supply:** The total supply is always equal to the number of verified users.  
3. **After Creation:** Once the coin is issued, users can interact freely using anonymous wallets if desired.  
4. **No Further Issuance:** You can’t create more. Not even by paying. It’s a fair share — not for sale.

## 🚀 The Vision

Fairsharecoin isn’t here to replace one power structure with another. It’s a **stepping stone**:

`Fiat → Crypto → A Fair Share → Resource-Based World`

No monetization. No centralization. No compromise of fairness.

Let’s build what comes *after* money.
