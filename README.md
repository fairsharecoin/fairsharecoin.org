# Fairsharecoin

**A digital stepping stone toward a fair and resource-based future.**

Fairsharecoin is not just a currency — it’s a concept.  
It proposes a single, equal unit of value given to each person, once, for free, with no strings attached.  
No mining. No speculation. No scarcity by design.

It is an experiment in pure fairness — a response to systems built on debt, interest, and inequality.  
Fairsharecoin is here to be **outgrown**, not hoarded. A protocol that, once fulfilled, will dissolve.

## Founder's Pledge

> This project will never include:
>
> - ❌ Monetization  
> - ❌ Insider allocation  
> - ❌ Compromises of fairness  
>
> Fairsharecoin exists to explore what a truly fair, post-scarcity, post-monetary system could look like — one where every human being receives a single share of value, simply by being alive.
>
> There will be no private sales, no mining, no staking rewards, and no speculation model. This is not a financial asset. It is a **message**, a **mirror**, and a **stepping stone**.
>
> The code will remain open, transparent, and permissionless.
>
> **Fairsharecoin is not here to dominate. It is here to dissolve.**  
> When its purpose is fulfilled, it will disappear — and leave only fairness behind.
