# 🛣️ Fairsharecoin Roadmap

Fairsharecoin is not a tech race. It is a trust mission.  
Our goal is to move deliberately, transparently, and with integrity at every step.

---

## 🌱 Phase 0: Vision Launch (✅ Completed)
- Register domain: [fairsharecoin.org](https://fairsharecoin.org)
- Publish initial message and project values
- Create GitHub profile and public repository
- Establish the Founder's Pledge
- Open public visibility with read-only content

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Community Formation (⚙️ In Progress)
- Begin collecting interest (via email form or GitHub stars)
- Publish call for contributors (designers, devs, writers, thinkers)
- Create initial discussion channels (GitHub Issues, optional Discord)
- Maintain strong alignment with values and vision

---

## 📐 Phase 2: Spec & Prototype (🧩 Planning)
- Draft Fairsharecoin technical model  
  (identity, distribution logic, limits, anti-abuse mechanisms)
- Explore proofs-of-personhood or fair allocation without centralization
- Begin prototype (non-monetary, non-transferable)
- Define governance structure (if any)

---

## 🔒 Phase 3: Verification & Ethics
- Open public audits of code, principles, and assumptions
- Gather interdisciplinary input: economics, ethics, philosophy, cryptography
- Define long-term immutability: when/how the protocol becomes unchangeable

---

## 🌍 Phase 4: Distribution Planning (Optional & Experimental)
- Discuss options for symbolic or practical distribution
- Prototype claiming system (e.g. one per unique verifiable human)
- Evaluate non-blockchain alternatives (off-chain proofs, local mirrors)

---

## ☀️ Phase 5: FSC Fulfilled
- When humanity evolves past the need for currency — FSC dissolves
- Protocols archived for history
- The fair share principle lives on in infrastructure, not tokens

---

## 🙌 Want to Help?

This is a community-driven effort. If you want to:
- Design UI, identity or minimal symbolic claiming
- Help with ethical or social system design
- Contribute ideas, writing, or quiet support

You're welcome here.  
This is for all of us — and eventually, for none of us.

🌍 *A fair share. For every human. Once. Forever.*
